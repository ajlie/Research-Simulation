## Overview
This is a result of interdisciplinary research of Andrea Lie and Dr. Micheal Piovosso on a simulation about Glioblastoma. The equation and models for this simulation was adapted from 
Mathematical model of brain tumour with glia–neuron interactions and chemotherapy treatment. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 368, 113–121. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.12.008]

## Simulation
These simulations were created in matlab which then output different graphs of the following, glial cells, glioma cells, nuerons and the chemotherapy agent, which are then linked to different CSV files
